00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi book lovers,
my name is Mek and I run OpenLibrary.org

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
over at the Internet Archive.

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:12,001
For those who aren't familiar, the Internet
Archive is a nonprofit here in San

4
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:17,000
Francisco, California, which is probably
most famous for the Wayback Machine.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The Wayback Machine is this mind-blowing
website that lets you go back in time

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and see a website as it was up to 20 years ago.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,001
So if I type in google.com into the
Wayback Machine, then I go back to

8
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:39,001
February 1999,
then I can see what Google used to look

9
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:45,000
like and things have changed
a whole ton since then.

10
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:57,000
Many people don't know that in addition
to running the Wayback Machine, the Internet Archive

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
is also a California state accredited digital library
and we have more than 4 million books that are publicly

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,001
accessible or that you can borrow
directly from your computer using

13
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,001
OpenLibrary.org.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,001
So Open Library has more than 4 million books.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Some of them are publicly accessible and
you can read them right in your browser

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,001
and some of them require borrowing through
our controlled digital lending system.

17
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:24,001
So if you happen to see a book that
strikes your fancy, maybe The Hitchhiker's

18
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:29,000
Guide to the Galaxy,
then we can click on it and we will be brought

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
to a books page.

20
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:35,000
The books page will give you
the opportunity to preview the

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,001
book, to borrow the book.

22
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:41,001
You don't need a special
library card to read or

23
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,001
borrow a book on OpenLibrary.org.

24
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:46,001
You just need an email
address and once you sign up,

25
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:48,000
you'll be able to borrow for free.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
In this case, why don't we click on
preview and we'll get a few pages of the

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
front matter, table of contents,
copyright page, and also the back page.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And once we're confident this is the book
that we want to borrow, we can either

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
click on the borrow button or there's also
a listen option, which is kind of like

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Siri, which uses your web browser's
high-quality Google or Apple voices to

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,001
read the book to you as if it's an audiobook.
So why don't we go ahead and borrow

32
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:26,000
the book and it should pop open the book
reader. There's a few different ways to

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,001
borrow the book.
The first one is offline reading.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,001
If you click PDF or EPUB, then you're
presented with an option to use a form of

35
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:42,001
protected DRM to read a PDF or EPUB
offline for two weeks and during that time

36
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:47,000
you're the only person who can access the book.
And it's done through a piece of

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,001
software called Adobe Digital Editions.

38
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:59,001
Another option that we have is using the
read aloud feature. So why don't we flip

39
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:03,001
to the beginning of a chapter here and
if you click the speaker button in the

40
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:08,000
lower right-hand corner of the book,
you'll see that it activates this read aloud

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:23,000
control panel. And why don't we press
play, hear what that sounds like.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
"Chapter 4 Far away on the opposite spiral arm
of the Galaxy, five hundred thousand light years

43
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:26,001
from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, president
of the Imperial Galactic Government,

44
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:32,001
sped across the seas of Damogran, his ion drive
delta boat winking and flashing in the Damogran sun."

45
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:39,000
So if that's a little too slow for you,
you can speed it up to 1.25 or 1.5x.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
"Chapter 4 Far away on the opposite spiral arm"

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,001
"Chapter 4 Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the"

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,001
All right. In addition to being able to
read offline, read normally, or also to

49
00:03:53,001 --> 00:04:00,000
use the audio controls,
we have the search inside feature. So if there's

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,001
a quote we're trying to remember from a book,
let's see if I got it right, then

51
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:10,001
we should see, these pins on the navigation
bar that correlate to the matches

52
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:15,000
within the book. I click it and I see the
famous "So long and thanks for all the

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
fish." Now I can either click the back
button and return to Open Library or even

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
though I have 13 days left on my loan,
I can click return book, which I'm gonna

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
do so that someone else might enjoy it.
And once the book is returned, it will

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,001
bring me back to OpenLibrary.org.
I'm presented with a Goodreads style button

57
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:44,001
that allows me to mark this book either
as want to read, that I've already read

58
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:47,000
it, or currently reading. I'm gonna
click currently reading so that I can

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,001
save that in my book log.
And I could also choose a number

60
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:53,000
of stars if I want to rate it.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,001
Up on the top of the website,
there's a tab called My Books, which lets me

62
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:02,000
navigate to my loans,
or also to see all of the books on my

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,001
reading log. So I'm gonna click that.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Here I see a list of all of the
books that are on my reading log.

65
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:14,000
And if I want to, I can manage the privacy
settings and share this with a friend

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,001
so they can see what I'm reading.
In some cases, you'll notice that a book

67
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:24,001
does not have a read or borrow button
because it has not yet been acquired or

68
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:28,000
digitized. And this is where you can step in.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Everyone in the world has an opportunity
to be a part of Open Library and make

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
titles available by sponsoring a book.
If you go to OpenLibrary.org slash

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
sponsorship or click this button,
you'll be presented with information

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,001
on how you can sponsor a book.

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If you look through the available titles,
you might find that there's a book on

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,001
Frida and you happen to be an enthusiast
for Mexican culture. And so if you click

75
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:59,000
the sponsor button, you'll be presented
with a page where you can make a tax

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
deductible donation. Within one month,
the book will be purchased, shipped,

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
digitized, and made available on OpenLibrary.org,
and you'll have the opportunity

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,001
to be the first to borrow the book and to
also have a message publicly display on

79
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:18,001
OpenLibrary.org
as the donor should you wish to. Back on

80
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:24,001
Open Library, you can also take advantage
of our search functionality. So you

81
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:31,000
might search for a book by title
like GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach, or

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
similarly, you can search by author.

83
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:38,000
And here you'll see all of the
books that we have by J.K. Rowling.

84
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,001
Let's choose Harry Potter
and the Philosopher's Stone.

85
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:53,000
So now we're on a works page and it shows
all of the different editions of this

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,001
book that are available, from Greek to
Russian to Chinese to Latin to Spanish and

87
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:04,001
even Latvian, and of course, a handful of
books in English as well. If we select

88
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:08,000
one of the editions, we'll be brought
back to the book page where we again,

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
can preview or borrow. And if we click
on the edition count in the upper left

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,001
hand corner, we'll be brought back to
the works page.

91
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:20,001
And if you are a teacher or
a parent, an educator, librarian,

92
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:27,000
you can use the browse functionality to
see a listing of all subjects, which span

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
fiction to nonfiction, books on science
and mathematics, including textbooks on

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
biology, chemistry, children's books,
stories and rhyme, picture books, bedtime

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,001
books, history books,
biographies and autobiographies.

96
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:48,001
I hope you've enjoyed this tour of Open
Library. Not only are we a non-profit

97
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:54,000
project, we're also an open source project.
And that means over a hundred people

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
from around the world have helped contribute
to make OpenLibrary.org the world's

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
library.
That is Amsterdam, New Zealand, Toronto, India,

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,001
Massachusetts, California and beyond.

101
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:17,001
Especially today, as libraries and
schools across the country and world are

102
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:22,001
shutting down, the Internet Archive is
committed to making our information as

103
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:27,000
broadly, publicly accessible as possible.
If you would like to contribute to

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,001
OpenLibrary.org or if you have any
questions about our service, don't hesitate

105
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:36,001
and send me an email at mek,
that's M-E-K @ archive.org.

106
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:42,000
We'd be delighted to hear from you.
Thanks for taking a look at Open Library at

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the Internet Archive and happy reading.
